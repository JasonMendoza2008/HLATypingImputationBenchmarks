# HLA Typing Imputation Open Source Benchmarks
Repository containing every inputs and outputs of different HLA typing imputation tools' for 
reproducibility purposes when we relied on data that could be shared for these extra tests.

## Data
This repository is aimed at providing a reproducible benchmark for HLA typing imputation tools. The data
used for this benchmark comes from Nizhny Novgorod, Russia [1] and used as an external testing set on which
none of these tools were trained diminishing the risk of overtting (n = 1510). The testing data consists of NGS
data from 1510 individuals with high-resolution typings for loci HLA-A, -C, -B, -DRB1, -DQB1. The data does not contain
ambiguities such as the standard non resolved ambiguities like DQB1*02:01:01G (corresponding to either DQB1*02:01 or 
DQB1*02:02 or DQB1*02:04 or DQB1*02:06).
